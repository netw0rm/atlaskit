AtlasKit is the Design Platform's implementation of ADG3.
It is a collection of reusable webcomponents that can be consumed independently (no more upgrade pains!).
Each component is independently versioned and published to npm, a list can be found in the [registry](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).

# Development

### Getting started

#### Prerequisites
* [node](https://nodejs.org/) version should be 6 or above (to check `node -v`)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version should be 3 or above (to check `npm --version`) or use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) should be installed globally (`npm install -g yarn@0.18.1`)

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:atlassian/atlaskit.git
yarn
```
You're now ready to start developing in AtlasKit!

Once you made some changes, stage them and then commit them using `yarn run commit` (This will use [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) under the covers).

# How do I...

## Generate a new component skeleton
```
yarn run create my-component-name
```

Will create a new templated component under `packages/my-component-name` with everything you need to get started.

```
|-- packages/
   |-- my-component-name/
     |-- docs/
        |-- USAGE.md
     |-- src/
        |-- host.less
        |-- shadow.less
        |-- index.js
        |-- shared-variables.less
    |-- stories/
       |-- example-story.js
       |-- .eslintrc
    |-- test/
       |-- index.js
       |-- .eslintrc
    |-- CHANGELOG.md (autogenerated)
    |-- LICENSE
    |-- package.json
    |-- README.md (autogenerated)
```


## Flesh-out a component
The functionality of your component will be contained in `src/index.js`. The template will contain a skate definition and styles will already be linked.

## Style a component
Styles for AtlasKit components are written in Less and are separated into three main files by default (`host.less`, `shadow.less`, `shared.less`).

### Style the host element using host.less
Is where you write styles that affect the component itself.

* These styles will be compiled and placed into the head of the page at runtime.
* They cannot affect the shadow DOM of a component (use `shadow.less` for that).
* This is where you would usually place rules that are based on attributes.

### Style the elements within the Shadow DOM using shadow.less
Is where you write styles that affect the shadow DOM of your component

* These are compiled and placed into the shadow DOM of each **instance** of a component `vdom.style(shadowStyles.toString());`
* These do not have access to the root element.

### Share Less variables using shared.less
This is where you can write styles that need to be shared between `shadow.less` and `host.less`. (Note the `@import 'shared.less';` at the top).
This should only be used for shared variables, not shared rules. By default, this will already include the shared colors from the `share-styles` package.

## Add a dependency to a component
Ensure that when running `npm install --save ...` you are in the component's directory, **not in the root!**.

## Verify a component bundle
If you want to check that webpack is correctly bundling your component, you can build it locally to confirm.

```
yarn run prepublish/single my-component-name
```

This will build the component and place the generated bundle under `packages/my-component-name/dist/`.

## Document a component
AtlasKit uses [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/)-style annotations to automatically generate the component API. See the `akutil-component-template` package for examples.

Modify `packages/my-component-name/USAGE.md` with usage instructions and examples for your component.

A `README.md` file will be generated at `packages/my-component-name/README.md`, by concatenating your `USAGE.md` file with the component API generated by JSDoc.

**Do not edit this README.md file**, as any changes will be overwritten.

You can regenerate the `README.md` file at any time by running `yarn run docs/single my-component-name`

## Test a component

### Storybook
AtlasKit uses [React Storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook) to provide interactive examples of each component.

#### Viewing the storybook

* To run a storybook for a single component: `yarn run storybook/single my-component-name`
* To run the storybook for all components: `yarn run storybook`

#### Publishing the storybook

* To output all storybooks as a static website: `yarn run storybook/static -- -o your_target_dir`
* To output a single component storybook as a static website: `yarn run storybook/static/single my-component-name -- -o your_target_dir`

### Unit tests

* To run unit tests for a single component: `yarn run test/single my-component-name`
* To continuously run tests for a single component: `yarn run test/single/watch my-component`

> You can pass arguments to Karma like this to override the AtlasKit defaults: `yarn run test/single my-component-name -- --browsers=Chrome`

### Browserstack tests
Browserstack is a tool that lets you run your unit tests in a larger set of browsers running different versions.

To run the Browserstack tests for a single component:

```
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=... BROWSERSTACK_KEY=... yarn run test/wc/single/browserstack my-component
```

You can also run all the Browserstack tests with Docker (as they are run in the CI):

```
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=... BROWSERSTACK_KEY=... docker-compose -f docker-compose-browserstack.yml up
```

### Follow code style guidelines
We are adhering to the [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) javascript linting rules, which can be quite strict.

Eslint will automatically run when attempting to commit, but can also run at any time using: `yarn run lint`

*Note:* a lot of linting issues can be fixed automatically by passing the --fix flag to eslint: `yarn run lint -- --fix`

### Modifying ESLint rules

In order to modify the ESLint rules, you can add the rules to the `.eslintrc` file in the `eslint-config-ak-base` package.

The packages are linked to the main atlaskit directory so that the new eslint configuration will be effective immediately.

Changes to the ESLint rules should be treated like any other package:

- If you fix a rule, it should be considered a fix
- If you add a rule, it should be considered a feature
- If you change / remove a rule, it should be considered breaking

## Commit changes
To ensure that all commit messages are formatted correctly, we use Commitizen in this repository. It provides a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)-like interface that creates your commit messages for you. Running commitizen is as simple as running `yarn run commit` from the root of the repo. You can pass all the same flags you would normally use with `git commit`.

```
yarn run commit -- -a
```
Note: it automatically runs [linting](#markdown-header-follow-code-style-guidelines) and validation *before* you commit, to prevent you from having to answer all the questions twice.


## Merge into master
All new feature code must be completed in a feature branch.

Once you are happy with your changes, you must push your branch to Bitbucket and create a pull request. All pull requests must have at least 2 reviewers from the AtlasKit team. Once the pull request has been approved it may be merged into master.

**Attention! Achtung! Bнимaние! Atención! ध्यान! 注意!**: *Merging into master will automatically release a component. See below for more details*

## Release a component
Releasing components is completely automated. The process of releasing will begin when changes are made to the `master` branch:

* Linting is run
* Tests will be run in Browserstack
* Component dist is built
* [semantic-release](https://github.com/atlassian/lerna-semantic-release) will bump the versions for any component that has changed
* Change log is generated automatically from commit messages
* Component will be published to npm

## Update a dependency of AtlasKit
* Install AtlasKit - if your installation is from before we had the shrinkwrap file, you should run `yarn run clean`.
* Install your new dependency: `yarn add my-package` (this updates the `yarn.lock file`).
* Create a PR

## Make changes to the Pipelines build
AtlasKit uses Bitbucket Pipelines for it's continuous integration. The build scripts are defined in `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`.

### CloudFront caching

If you ever need to purge the CF cache for AtlasKit (Storybooks, Registry, PR artifacts) you can use the `invalidate-atlaskit-cache` branch. Just rerun the last build or merge `master` into it.

### AtlasKit Docker image
Bitbucket pipelines works using a Docker image. This contains the initial setup required to run the build. If you need to make changes to `Dockerfile`, you will need to push them to Dockerhub:

Build the new Docker image:

```
yarn run build/docker/image
```

**Note:** Use the shared credentials to publish to docker (ask for access).

If you want to create a new image and download all the latest dependencies without actually changing the Dockerfile, you can use:

```console
yarn run build/docker/image -- --no-cache
```

**Note:** Make sure you also update the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file with the name of your new image!
