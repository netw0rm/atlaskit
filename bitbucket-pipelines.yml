# make sure not to use && as a continuation in any of these steps unless you pair it with || exit 1
# pipelines concats each of these commands into one script and runs that
# if your command in the script list has && joining it, and any of the steps fail, the pipeline will still continue
#
# please either put those commands in a script in ./build/bin
# or just place them in different items in the list i.e. change
#           - foo && bar && baz
# to
#           - foo
#           - bar
#           - baz
# or
#           - foo && bar && baz || exit 1
# or
#           - ./build/bin/foo-bar-baz.bash
