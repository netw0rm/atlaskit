# Avatar

## Synopsis

Avatars are used to add a human touch and instant clarity when understanding which user did what in 
the application. We also use avatars for projects, repositories, spaces, groups and other container 
metaphors within Atlassian apps.

## Setup and install

```
npm install ak-avatar
```

## Using the definition

The `ak-avatar` package exports the Avatar [skate](https://github.com/skatejs/skatejs) component:

```
import Avatar from 'ak-avatar';

const myAvatar = new Avatar();
```
