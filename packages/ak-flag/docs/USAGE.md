# Flag

Flags are used for confirmations, alerts, and acknowledgments that require minimal user interaction. They are event-driven messages that appear over screen content at the bottom left of the screen, emerging from the navigation.

Multiple flags can be shown at the same time. The top-most flag is always visible, with remaining flags stacked vertically underneath.
