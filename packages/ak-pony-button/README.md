Have you ever felt like you were something that you're not? If so, `ak-pony-button` is the component
for you.

`ak-pony-button` is a button that thinks it is a pony, hereafter referred to as a pony button.

This component was made as a test component for automatically generating documentation for AtlasKit

## Component API

### new PonyButton()
This button think it is a pony, but its really just a button.
I can write some more information about my pony button here.

This is a new paragraph. I'll write some more words here to pad it out.
There is a new line before this line but it should be in the same paragraph.
We can have some nicely formatted text here describing the component and giving some basic
information about its usage.

Here's some closing words in a third paragraph. Thanks for reading.
