# Navigation

This component is displayed as a sidebar and it contains two sections: "global" and "container". Both sections are used for navigating through different views and containers in a product.

Note: the previously-recommended [ak-page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ak-page) component is no longer used alongside `ak-navigation`. See below for how to use `@atlaskit/navigation` in your application.
