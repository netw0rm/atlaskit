      <Description>
        The Navigation component is a high level component that wraps many
        individual components. The general structure of the component is
        displayed below.
        <Code>{`
          Navigation
            - Global Navigation
              - Create
              - Search
            - Container Navigation
              - Container header
              - Items
            - Drawers
        `}</Code>
        The Global Navigation is the blue bar on the left, and is used for
        global product actions like search and create, and user account options.
        The Container Navigation is the grey bar on the right, and is used for
        container specific links and navigation. Navigation wraps both of these
        components, and passes props onto these children.
      </Description>
      <Props component={Navigation} descriptions={navigationPropDescriptions} />
    </Readme>
  ));
