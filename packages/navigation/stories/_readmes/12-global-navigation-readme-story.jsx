      <Description>
        The GlobalNavigation component represents the blue bar, and is a part of
        Navigation. This component will nearly always be used with
        ContainerNavigation as a part of Navigation, but it is provided as part
        of the API for use cases that do not require ContainerNavigation as
        well.
