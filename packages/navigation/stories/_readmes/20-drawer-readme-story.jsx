      <Description>
        Drawers fly out from the left hand side of the screen, and contain some
        actions that allow users to navigate between containers, or allow users
        to create content and containers.

        Usually the Navigation contaisn two main Drawers â€“ search and create.
        Other Drawers can be added that are triggered from ContainerItems â€“ you
        may want to do this instead of NestedNavigation in the collapsed state.
