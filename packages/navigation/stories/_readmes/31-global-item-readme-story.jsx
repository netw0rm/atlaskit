        The GlobalItem is the equivalent of NavigationItem, but for use in the
        GlobalNavigation. The difference is that these items are presented
        differently â€“ they can only contain icons, and have a circular
        background. When using the Navigation component, these items will pop
        through into the ContainerNaviation when the Navigation is in the
        collapsed state.
