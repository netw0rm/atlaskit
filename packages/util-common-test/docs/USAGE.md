<dd><p>waitUntil is a testHelper to wait an arbitrary amount of time until a
condition is met.
It takes in a function (the condition of when to keep running) and returns a promise.
This is useful when you want to make changes to a component and then ensure that it has been
rendered before performing any tests.
Within tests this is safe as they will automatically fail after 2000ms of not responding.</p>

## afterMutations()
Runs a list of functions, pausing between each one to ensure the component
   has had time to re-render.
   Ensure that you pass `done` into the test and that you call it at the end
   as this will make your tests asyncronous.

**Kind**: global function

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fn... | <code>function</code> | A list of functions to run in order.                    Each function is passed the return value of the last function                    (except for the last) |

**JS Example**
```js
it('should respond to prop changes', (done) => {
   afterMutations(
     () => expect(component).to.be.in.some.state,
     () => props(component, {propName, propValue}),
     () => expect(component).to.be.in.another.state,
     () -> props(component, {propName, anotherValue}),
     () => expect(component).to.be.in.another.another.state,
     done
   );
 });
```

<a name="hasClass"></a>

## hasClass(component, [...classes])
A simple helper method to check whether a node has a set of classNames on it.
 Will return true, only if a component is provided and it has all the classNames applied to it.

**Kind**: global function

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| component | <code>Node</code> | A node to check for classNames. |
| [...classes] | <code>String</code> | A list of classNames to check for the existance of |

**JS Example**
```js
const elem = document.querySelector('.fixture').firstChild;
 const elemIsHidden = hasClass(elem, 'hidden');
 const elemIsSelectedAndHidden = hasClass(elem, 'hidden', 'selected');
```

<a name="keydown"></a>

## keydown(key, options)
Simulate a user's keydown input

**Kind**: global function

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key |  | – the key to press, will be passed to keycode |
| options | <code>Object</code> | – options for the event. |
| options.target |  | – a DOM element to trigger the event on. Default:triggered on the document. |
| options.eventProperties | <code>Object</code> | – properties to assign to the event (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent) |

<a name="keyup"></a>

## keyup(key, options)
Simulate a user's keyup input

**Kind**: global function

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key |  | – the key to press, will be passed to keycode |
| options | <code>Object</code> | – options for the event. |
| options.target |  | – a DOM element to trigger the event on. Default:triggered on the document. |
| options.eventProperties | <code>Object</code> | – properties to assign to the event (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent) |

<a name="keypress"></a>

## keypress(key, options)
Simulate a user's keypress input

**Kind**: global function

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key |  | – the key to press, will be passed to keycode |
| options | <code>Object</code> | – options for the event. |
| options.target |  | – a DOM element to trigger the event on. Default:triggered on the document. |
| options.eventProperties | <code>Object</code> | – properties to assign to the event (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent) |

<a name="checkInvisibility"></a>

## checkInvisibility(elem)
returns true if and only if `elem` is invisible

**Kind**: global function

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
| elem | – the element to check |

<a name="checkVisibility"></a>

## checkVisibility(elem)
returns true if and only if `elem` is visible

**Kind**: global function

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
| elem | – the element to check |

<a name="waitUntil"></a>

## waitUntil(fn, timeout, step)
waitUntil is a testHelper to wait an arbitrary amount of time until a
condition is met.
It takes in a function (the condition of when to keep running) and returns a promise.
This is useful when you want to make changes to a component and then ensure that it has been
rendered before performing any tests.
Within tests this is safe as they will automatically fail after 2000ms of not responding.

**Kind**: global function

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
| fn | function that must return true when it is time for the promise to continue |
| timeout | maximum amount of time waitUntil should wait before quiting (ms). |
| step | amount of time to wait between checks of the `fn` condition (ms). |

**JS Example**
```js
const elem = document.querySelector('.fixture').firstChild;
 // We put name our condition function so we can re-use it a couple of times
 const elemRenderedImgTag = () => (elem.shadowRoot.querySelector('img') !== null);

 // check that no image is rendered before we start
 expect(elemRenderedImgTag()).to.equal(false);

 // set a property to make the image be rendered
 elem.showImage = true;

 // now wait until we can see the image rendered
 waitUntil(elemRenderedImgTag).then(() => (expect(elemRenderedImgTag()).to.equal(true)));

 // alternatively, we might want to do more things in the .then call, even chain more waitUntils

 waitUntil(elemRenderedImgTag).then(() => {
   expect(elemRenderedImgTag()).to.equal(true);
   doSomeMoreStuff(elem);
   return waitUntil(someOtherConditionIsTrue());
 }).then(() => {
   // Now we can do more stuff in here!
    });

 // You can also set a maximum amount of time to wait (and how long to wait in between attempts)
 waitUntil(elemRenderedImgTag, 1000, 10).then(() =>
 (expect(elemRenderedImgTag()).to.equal(true)));
 // this will check if the img was rendered every 10ms for up to a total of ~1 second.
```
